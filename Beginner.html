        <h1>Mountain Fold AND Valley Fold</h1>
   <h2>These are the two basic folds in origami. Pretty much every fold is either
 a mountain fold, a valley fold or a combination of the two</h2>
        <a href=""><img src="images/mountain_fold.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>With a Mountain Fold the crease bends the paper down and the crease resembles a mountain.</p>
        <a href=""><img src="images/valley_fold.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>With a Valley Fold the crease bends the paper up and the crease resembles a valley.</p>
<h1>Common Origami Folds</h1>
<h2>Here are the most common folds with step by step instructions how to make them.
These folds might not look exactly the same as they do in these examples all the time
when you’re folding other models. However these examples should show you how they
work so you’ll be able to figure out what you’re supposed to do when you’re
following diagrams.</h2>
<ul>
    <li><i>Inside Reverse Fold</i></li>
</ul>
<h4>This is a very common fold in origami where the paper is folded inside of the
model.</h4>
<a href=""><img src="images/inside-reverse-fold-1.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Start with a square of paper, white side up and fold it in half diagonally.
This isn’t actually part of the Inside Reverse Fold but it’ll give you a shape
that you can use to make the Inside Reverse Fold on.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/inside-reverse-fold-2.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Fold along the dotted line. This is where you’re going to make the inside
reverse fold. Your fold doesn’t have to match the exact position of the line
so don’t worry if it doesn’t measure up exactly.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/inside-reverse-fold-3.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Crease this fold well and then unfold it.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/inside-reverse-fold-4.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Turn the paper over.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/inside-reverse-fold-5.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Make a fold along the dotted line. This will be the opposite side of the fold 
you made earlier. Now you’re folding this the other way.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/inside-reverse-fold-6.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Crease this fold well and then unfold it.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/inside-reverse-fold-7.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Turn the paper over again so it’s back the way it was before.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/inside-reverse-fold-8.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Push the paper inside the model following the two folds you made before.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/inside-reverse-fold-9.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Push the paper all the way inside the model and flatten along the creases you 
already made.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/inside-reverse-fold-10.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>The completed Inside Reverse Fold. The dotted line shows the path of the paper 
inside the model.</p>
<ul>
    <li><i>Outside Reverse Fold</i></li>
</ul>
<h4>The fold is the opposite of the Inside Reverse Fold. This time the paper is
folded outside of the model.</h4>
<a href=""><img src="images/outside-reverse-fold-1.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Start with a square of paper, white side up and fold it in half diagonally.
This isn’t part of the Outside Reverse Fold but it will give us a shape we can
use to demonstrate the fold.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/outside-reverse-fold-2.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p> Fold the paper along the dotted line. This will be where you will make the
Outside Reverse Fold. Your fold doesn’t have to line up exactly where the line
is so don’t worry about making it completely perfect.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/outside-reverse-fold-3.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Crease this fold well and then unfold it.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/outside-reverse-fold-4.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Turn the paper over.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/outside-reverse-fold-5.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p> Fold the paper along the dotted line. This will be the opposite side of the 
crease you made earlier.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/outside-reverse-fold-6.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Crease this well and then unfold it.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/outside-reverse-fold-7.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Fold the paper outside the model along the creases you already made. To make
it a bit easier you can open the model up.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/outside-reverse-fold-8.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Fold the paper down along the creases you already made.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/outside-reverse-fold-9.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>As you fold the paper down close the model up again along the crease you made
in step 1. The paper you folded down should flatten nicely on the outside of the
model.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/outside-reverse-fold-10.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>The completed Outside Reverse Fold. It’s the opposite of the Inside Reverse
Fold. The shape of the fold is essentially the same it’s just folded the other
way and outside the model.</p>
<ul>
    <li><i>Rabbit Ear Fold</i></li>
</ul>
<h4>This fold results in a flap of paper that kind of resembles a rabbit's ear
which is where the fold gets its name.</h4>
<a href=""><img src="images/rabbit-ear-fold-1.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Start with a square of paper with the white side up. Fold the paper in half
along the dotted line and then unfold it. You will use this line a guide in 
later steps.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/rabbit-ear-fold-2.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p> Fold the paper along the dotted line. It should line up with the crease
you made in step 1.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/rabbit-ear-fold-3.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Crease this well and unfold.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/rabbit-ear-fold-4.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Fold the paper on the other side along the dotted line. 
It should also line up with the crease you made in step 1.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/rabbit-ear-fold-5.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p> Crease this well and unfold it.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/rabbit-ear-fold-6.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p> Fold both sides of the paper along the dotted lines back to the centre 
following the two creases you just made. The paper will bunch up in the middle
and you will make a new crease along that small vertical dotted line.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/rabbit-ear-fold-7.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p> After step 6 you should have a triangle shaped flap of paper. Fold this
down to the side. In general it doesn’t matter which side you fold this flap
down to. Different models will have different instructions for which side to
fold it to.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/rabbit-ear-fold-8.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>The completed Rabbit Ear Fold.</p>
<ul>
    <li><i>Squash Fold</i></li>
</ul>
<h4>With this fold you essentially take a flap of paper and squash it flat.</h4>
<a href=""><img src="images/squash-fold-1.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>This example starts with a Preliminary Base. The instructions for this
base are further in this guide. Squash folds can be performed on a variety
of different shapes, not just this base.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/squash-fold-2.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>There are four flaps of paper on this base, lift one of them up. 
You will make a squash fold on this flap.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/squash-fold-3.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Push down on the crease so you completely flatten the flap. Make sure
both sides are symmetrical.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/squash-fold-4.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>The completed Squash Fold.</p>
<ul>
    <li><i>Pleat</i></li>
</ul>
<h4>This is a very simple, basic fold.</h4>
<a href=""><img src="images/pleat1.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>This example uses a rectangle shaped sheet of paper but you can 
easily make this fold with a square or any other shape. Fold the paper
to the side along the dotted line.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/pleat2.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p> Fold the paper back the other way along the dotted line. 
Note that this new fold is a little bit to the left of the first fold you made.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/pleat3.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>The Completed Pleat. If you look at the shape of the fold from the side it kind 
of looks like a letter Z.</p>
<ul>
    <li><i>Crimp</i></li>
</ul>
<h4>This is very much like a Pleat but made on the outside of the paper almost like
an Outside Reverse Fold.</h4>
<a href=""><img src="images/crimp-01-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p> Start off with a square sheet of paper with the white side up. Fold the paper
in half along the dotted line and then unfold it.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/crimp-02-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p> Next make a Pleat by folding the paper to the left along the dotted line. Your
fold doesn’t have to match the one in the diagram exactly. It just needs to be roughly
in the same place.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/crimp-03-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Fold the paper back to the right along the dotted line. Your fold doesn’t need to be
exactly in the same place as the diagram. This is just practice. You now have a Pleat.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/crimp-04-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Fold the paper in half again along the crease you made in step 1.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/crimp-05-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>The completed Crimp. Notice how it’s kind of like a pleat made on the 
outside of both sides of the paper.</p>
<ul>
    <li><i>Petal Fold</i></li>
</ul>
<h4>This is a fairly common fold and it's part of the Bird Base.</h4>
<a href=""><img src="images/petal-fold-01-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p> For this example start off with a Square Base. The instructions for this
base are later in this guide. This is the most common way to make a Petal Fold.
Fold the top right flap of paper to the centre along the dotted line.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/petal-fold-02-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p> Crease this fold well and then unfold it.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/petal-fold-03-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Fold the top left flap of paper to the centre along the dotted line.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/petal-fold-04-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Crease this fold well and then unfold it.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/petal-fold-05-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Fold the top part of the model down along the dotted line. The end points 
of this line should line up with the tops of the lines from the two creases
you just made.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/petal-fold-06-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p> Crease this fold well and then unfold it.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/petal-fold-07-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Open up the top flap of paper folding it upwards along the horizontal crease
you just made.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/petal-fold-08-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>As you lift the paper up also fold in the sides along the two creases you
made on each side.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/petal-fold-09-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Lift the paper all the way up and flatten everything along the 3 creases you 
already made. If you made the creases well everything should fall into place 
easily.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/petal-fold-10-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>The completed Petal Fold.</p>
<ul>
    <li><i>Petal Fold Variation</i></li>
</ul>
<h4>This is a slightly less common variation of the Petal Fold. It's used in 
the Frog Base.</h4>
<a href=""><img src="images/petal-fold-variation-01-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p> Start off with a Square Base that has one of the four flaps Squash Folded. This is
the exact shape that you’ll usually see this Petal Fold Variation made on. Fold the top
right flap to the centre along the dotted line.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/petal-fold-variation-02-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Crease this fold well and then unfold it.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/petal-fold-variation-03-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Fold the top left flap to the centre along the dotted line.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/petal-fold-variation-04-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Crease this well and then unfold it.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/petal-fold-variation-05-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Lift the top flap of paper up along the dotted horizontal line opening it up. There
is no pre-existing crease along this line so you’ll have to make it yourself as you fold
the flap up.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/petal-fold-variation-06-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p> As you fold up the flap of paper also fold in the sides along the creases you already
made on each side and push everything flat.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/petal-fold-variation-07-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>The completed Petal Fold Variation.</p>
<ul>
    <li><i>Swivel Fold</i></li>
</ul>
<h4>The Swivel Fold comes up a lot in origami and is somewhat similar to the Petal Fold Variation.</h4>
<a href=""><img src="images/swivel-fold-01-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Start off with a Square Base that has one of the four flaps Squash Folded. You can make a swivel
fold on many different shapes but this one is easy to demonstrate. Fold the top left flap of paper 
to the centre along the dotted line.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/swivel-fold-02-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p> Crease this fold well and unfold it.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/swivel-fold-03min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Lift up the top flap of paper making a fold along the dotted line from the top of the previous 
fold to the corner of the top coloured section of paper. There isn’t a crease here already so you’ll
have to make this fold on your own as best you can.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/swivel-fold-04min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>As you fold along that dotted line the paper will automatically fold along the crease you already
made on the left side. Push everything completely flat.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/swivel-fold-05min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>The completed Swivel Fold.</p>
<ul>
    <li><i>Open Sink</i></li>
</ul>
<h4>This is the most difficult fold in this guide. If you can't fold it now don't worry. Keep
practicing and eventually you'll get it. You won't see this fold in any beginner level models
anyways.</h4>
<a href=""><img src="images/open-sink-01-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>For this example start off with a Square Base. The instructions for this base are later in 
this guide. Fold the top part of the model down along the dotted line. This is just practice so
don’t worry about making your fold in exactly the same place as the diagram.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/open-sink-02-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Crease this fold very well and then unfold it.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/open-sink-03-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p> Turn the model over.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/open-sink-04-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Fold the top part of the model down along the dotted line. This will be along the crease
you already made. Now you’re folding it the opposite direction.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/open-sink-05-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Crease this fold very well and then unfold it.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/open-sink-06-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p> The easiest way to make the Open Sink in this example is to open the paper up completely.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/open-sink-07-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Push the paper inside the model following the square of creases that you made.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/open-sink-08-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p> As you push the paper inside start to close the model back up folding along the creases 
that make the Square Base.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/open-sink-09-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Continue sinking the paper inside the model following the existing creases and continue to
close the model back into the Square Base.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/open-sink-10-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p> Your paper should look something like this. Fold everything completely flat.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/open-sink-11-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>The completed Open Sink. The dotted line shows the path of the paper inside the model.
Instead of sticking out like it was before the triangle at the top is now sunk inside the model.</p>
<h1>Origami Bases</h1>
<h2>There are several bases in origami that are used to start many different models. For example
the bird base is the start of many paper birds. Often times you’ll see instructions telling you 
to start with a particular base just to save some time or space in the instructions. There aren’t
too many bases and you’ll see the same ones repeated a lot of times in different models.</h2>
<ul>
    <li><i>Kite Base</i></li>
</ul>
<h4>This is the most simple base in origami and it kind of looks like a kite which is where the
name comes from.</h4>
<a href=""><img src="images/kite-base-01-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Start with a square sheet of paper with the white side up. Fold it in
half along the dotted line and unfold. You will use this line as a guide in later steps.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/kite-base-02-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Fold the right side of the paper along the dotted line to the centre.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/kite-base-03-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Fold the left side of the paper along the dotted line to the centre.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/kite-base-04-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>The completed Kite Base.</p>
<ul>
    <li><i>Square or Preliminary Base</i></li>
</ul>
<h4>This is probably the most common base in origami and is used in many different models. 
Sometimes this base is called a Square Base and sometimes it's referred to as a Preliminary Base.</h4>
<a href=""><img src="images/square-base-01-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Start with a square sheet of paper with the white side up. Fold it in half along the dotted line.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/square-base-02-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Fold the paper in half again along the dotted line.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/square-base-03-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Bring the top flap of paper up.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/square-base-04-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Squash fold this flap of paper down. Make sure you keep both sides symmetrical. You should end
up with a diamond shape.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/square-base-05-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Turn the model over.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/square-base-06-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Lift up the top left flap of paper to the middle.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/square-base-07-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>Squash fold this flap of paper down. Make sure you keep both sides symmetrical. You should
end up with a diamond shape matching the one on the other side.</p>
<a href=""><img src="images/square-base-08-min.jpg" width=300 height=250/></a>
<p>The completed Square or Preliminary Base.</p>
